# Write code for the function random_noun, which takes in no inputs but outputs 
# one of two nouns randomly. Use the randint function to generate a number 
# from 0-1 and return a noun depending on whether the number is equal to 0 or 1. 
# Feel free to experiment with different nouns, but for submission purposes return 
# the string "sofa" if the number is 0, else return "llama".

from random import randint

a = random.randint(0,1)
    # your code here
if 1 != a:
    return "sofa"
else:
    return "llama"
